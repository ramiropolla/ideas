# ideas
Long list of projects that will likely never be finished (or maybe even started)...

## Crass Tricktisch
- Write blog post about powering the motor with various methods
- Write blog post about three-phase inverter
- Write blog post about the result

## ASCIImaton
- Find an old Photomaton
 - Design Photomaton with the looks of old (ca. 80s) computers and printers.
- Find a dot-matrix printer
- Develop img2txt algorithm
 - Algorithm should be tuned to work in only one scenario: with a very controlled light coming from flash or LED
- Implement it all in a raspberry pi

## IDA cpu module for upd7810
- Write IDA cpu module for upd7810
- Test with Action Printer 2000 firmware

## CIV2 decompilation
- Write blog with bits and pieces of decompilation
- Build theme based on dialogs from game

## Battery-powered flash strobe
- Study capacitor charging 
- Implement in arduino (helps project below)

## Arduino-powered SMPS
- Under a new tag in the blog
- Build one prototype (*with* control system!) for each topology
- Write a blog post for each result
- Use junk for parts

## Urinal generator
- Use a small motor and try to generate enough power to light LEDs
- If possible, make a pee-o-meter

## Broken camera photo app
- Looks for pictures on the net with your GPS coordinates
- If possible, get compass information as well (like that app that shows the stars)

## MAMEscope
- Check if it's feasible to overwrite the firmware in the Rigol DS1054Z oscilloscope
- Plug controller to USB port
- Play Mario!

## PrinterMESS
- Implement a printer driver for Windows which uses MESS as the backend
