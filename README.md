# ideas
Long list of projects that will likely never be finished (or maybe even started)...

## Crass Tricktisch
- Write blog post about powering the motor with various methods
- Write blog post about three-phase inverter
- Write blog post about the result

## ASCIImaton
- Find an old Photomaton
 - Design Photomaton with the looks of old (ca. 80s) computers and printers.
- ~~Find a dot-matrix printer~~ (found 2 already)
 - ASTECH M-1 (simple, small, fast!)
 - NEC PinWriter P72 (BIG, takes A3 paper!)
- Develop img2txt algorithm
 - Algorithm should be tuned to work in only one scenario: with a very controlled light coming from flash or LED
- Implement it all in a raspberry pi

## ~~IDA cpu module for upd7810~~
- ~~Write IDA cpu module for upd7810~~
- ~~Test with Action Printer 2000 firmware~~
- not worth the effort, I'll write a more useful cpu when I have enough devices with the same chip

## CIV2 decompilation
- Write blog with bits and pieces of decompilation
- Build theme based on dialogs from game

## Battery-powered flash strobe
- Study capacitor charging 
- Implement in arduino (helps project below)

## Arduino-powered SMPS
- Under a new tag in the blog
- Build one prototype (*with* control system!) for each topology
- Write a blog post for each result
- Use junk for parts

## Urinal generator
- Use a small motor and try to generate enough power to light LEDs
- If possible, make a pee-o-meter

## Broken camera photo app
- Looks for pictures on the net with your GPS coordinates
- If possible, get compass information as well (like that app that shows the stars)

## MAMEscope
- Check if it's feasible to overwrite the firmware in the Rigol DS1054Z oscilloscope
- Plug controller to USB port
- Play Mario!

## PrinterMESS
- Implement a printer driver for Windows which uses MESS as the backend
 - Try using RedMon <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/>
- Save result to PDF
- Show printer, motor, and noises? (nah...)
- Run MESS at full speed

## Safe Bike Map
- Android App
- Logs GPS information
- Uses echo location to see how far objects come to your left (right in the UK)
- Upload info to server
- Mark hotspots of dangerous places for bikers
